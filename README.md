- [OldGlory](https://github.com/Jonius7/SteamUI-OldGlory/releases/latest) (Optional)  

SteamFriendsPatcher is used to apply themes to the modern Steam Friends and Library UI, and OldGlory is a tool that installs Themes and CSS+JS Tweaks. You can read more about it here:
[OldGlory Wiki](https://github.com/Jonius7/SteamUI-OldGlory/blob/dev/README.md)

## Manual Installation

If you want to install the theme manually without using OldGlory, follow the steps below for your operating system.

### WARNING! It's a good idea to backup the files you need to replace before proceeding in case something goes wrong.

### Windows
- Head over to `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamui/`
- Copy or drag `libraryroot.custom.css` and `config.css` into the folder
- When everything is in place, run SteamFriendsPatcher and you're all set!  

If the patcher didn't work, click the `[Force Check]` button.

### macOS (Coming Soon)
- Right click on Finder, select "Go to Folder..." and put this in the search path:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/Steam.AppBundle/Steam/Contents/MacOS/skins/YourSkinName/resource`
- Copy or drag `webkit.css` and replace the existing file (if there is one)
- Restart Steam and you're all done!
    
### Linux (Coming Soon)
- Open a Terminal, then copy and paste the following line:
- `~/.local/share/Steam/skins/YourSkinName/resource`
